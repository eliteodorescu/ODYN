# ODYN
Open-source software analysis tool to investigate space plasma turbulence and nonlinear DYNamics

ODYN â€“ is a versatile modularized software library that wraps a comprehensive set of advanced data analysis methods meant to facilitate the study of turbulence, nonlinear dynamics and intermittency in space plasmas. Python programming language is used for the algorithmic implementation of models and methods devised to understand fundamental phenomena of space plasma physics e.g. elements of spectral analysis, probability distribution functions and their moments, multifractal analysis or information theory.  ODYN is open-source and freely available to any user interested in turbulence and nonlinear dynamics analysis and provides a tool to perform automatic analysis on large collections of selected space measurements, in-situ or simulations, a feature that distinguishes ODYN from other similar software. A user-friendly configurator is provided which allows customization of key parameters of the analysis methods, most useful for non-programmers.
